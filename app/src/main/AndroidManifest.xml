### Why this fixes the build:
1.  **Resource Linker:** The error `resource xml/widget_info not found` is like a missing puzzle piece. Adding that file completes the puzzle.
2.  **Icon Fix:** By changing `@mipmap/ic_launcher` to `@android:drawable/sym_def_app_icon`, we tell the app to use a standard system icon instead of looking for a file that isn't there.
3.  **Pathing:** Once these files exist in the `res` (resources) folder, the `processDebugResources` task will finally turn green.



### Your APK Status:
* **Step 1:** Add these files/changes.
* **Step 2:** Wait ~4 minutes for the GitHub Action to run.
* **Step 3:** The widget will finally appear in the **Widget List** on your emulator.

**Would you like me to give you the code for the "Main Override" Clock Engine file now, so the RGB colors start rolling as soon as the build finishes?**
